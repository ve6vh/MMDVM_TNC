# MMDVM_TNC
Work on MMDVM TNC code.

## kissgen
A Kiss message generator that can run on a PC or Pi platform. Good for debugging. Uses the serial port code from STM32Flash,
so it can be compiled to run on a PC by replacing the serial port handling code with the windows version.

## Code
A rework of MMDVM_TNC to only implemenet the DMR mode (mode 2), converted to be device independent and to use STM Cube IDE.
